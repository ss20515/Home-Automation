# Home-Automation
This will be used as the site for the home automation system


## Introduction

The objective of this project is to implement a low cost, reliable and scalable home automation 
system that can be used to remotely control different aspects of the house. The different aspects 
include controlling appliances, intruder alarm system, fire alarm system, temperature control, 
garage shutter control etc.
To interact with this system remotely we provide android app for smartphone users and a 
website for other platform users.
